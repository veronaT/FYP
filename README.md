Final Year Project: A MINIMAL SET OF END USER FRIENDLY STATISTICAL TESTS

The goal for the project is to tackle the issue of the lack of reliable and user-friendly statistical testing methods used to measure the randomness of random number generators.

My Final Year Project Report can also be found as a PDF in this folder. Link to github repo is:https://github.com/veronaT/FYP

HOW TO USE:
Open the executable named interface.exe and should bring up an interface that looks like this:

In the test folder there are three folders each with 100 files of data. PRNG being urandom, NRNG being non-random data and FRNG being e-hole data. 

The 'execute test' button is used to run the test if a file is uploaded and data will be outputted in the visable slots and 

'test' button is used to take a directory input and run through the data in the folder dir and output a CSV file with the results in the FYP folder
